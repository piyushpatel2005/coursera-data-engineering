    "# Week 2 Lab: Simple Data Lake with AWS Glue\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will work with a simple data lake that uses Amazon S3 as its primary storage. The data lake bucket contains raw JSON files that you will transform using AWS Glue ETL, and then store the processed data in the same bucket. You will finally use AWS Glue crawler to populate the Glue data catalog with metadata about your processed data, and then use Amazon Athena to query your data using SQL statements. In the optional part of the lab, you will explore the effects of compression and partitioning when storing your data in S3.\n",

    "If you get stuck while completing the coding exercises, you can download the solution files by running the following command in your Cloud9 environment:\n",

    "Assume you work as a Data Engineer at a retailer specializing in scale models of classic cars and other transportation. The data analysts are interested in conducting trend analysis for the top products reviewed in Amazon, to inform new product development. Recently, your team acquired Amazon toy review data and product info, and stored them in a data lake bucket. You are asked to clean the data and ensure its accessibility, so that the data analysts can retrieve the data with SQL-based queries. For the initial testing phase, the team has opted to use AWS Glue ETL for the initial data cleaning, and Amazon Athena to query the data. "

    "\n",
    "AWS Glue Crawler is a powerful automated tool offered by AWS Glue for discovering and cataloging metadata about data sources, which enables services like Glue and Athena to query data directly from different sources. By simply pointing the crawler to your data source, whether it's a database or a data lake, it will automatically scan and extract the schema information, data types, and other relevant metadata. This metadata is then organized and stored in a database table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, providing a centralized repository for understanding and managing your data assets. In this lab, you will create a crawler that will be in charge of populating the Glue Data Catalog with the newly transformed data in S3, you will be able to query the data directly from S3 using Athena in the final part.\n",

    "## 7 - Optional Experiments: Partitioning and Compression Features of Parquet Format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parquet format, commonly used in data lake architectures, supports various [compression codecs](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/compression/) such as Snappy, Gzip, and LZO. These codecs play a crucial role in reducing the storage space needed by Parquet files. However, they come with a trade-off: while they reduce storage costs and optimize resource utilization, they can also impact processing speeds during data ingestion, transformation, and querying. To test this with a practical example, you will store the same transformed data using three different compression options: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY` and `GZIP`: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNCOMPRESSED`: Data is left uncompressed.\n",
    "- `SNAPPY`: Snappy is a fast compression/decompression library that works well with Parquet files. It provides good compression ratios and is optimized for speed. Snappy compression is often a good choice for balancing compression efficiency and query performance.\n",
    "- `GZIP`: Gzip is a widely used compression algorithm that provides high compression ratios. However, it tends to be slower in both compression and decompression compared to Snappy. Gzip compression can achieve higher levels of compression but may result in slower query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning in Parquet is a technique used to better organize data within Parquet files based on partition keys. By partitioning data, Parquet optimizes query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned during query execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiments**\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the compression features, you will process the product metadata 3 times; in each time, you will choose a different option for the compression algorithm with no partitioning as shown in the left table here. Then you will compare for this data, \"uncompressed versus Snappy\" and then \"Snappy versus Gzip\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the partitioning features, you will process the review dataset 3 times; in each time, you will choose a different option for the partitioning column, with Snappy for compression. Then you will compare for this data, \"partitioning versus no partitioning\" and then \"partitioning by year and month\" versus \"partitioning by the product id (asin)\".\n",

    "When comparing the final output of these last two commands, you can see that using the year and month columns as partition keys generated around 556 files with a total size of less than 600MB. On the other hand, using the asin column (which is the identifier for each product) as the partition key can generate thousands of files. However, this job failed due to a timeout, resulting in a smaller total size as not all data was saved. This illustrates one of the issues that may arise when using inappropriate partition keys.\n",

However, with the asin partition key, given that some products may have very few reviews and there's a large number of products, the Glue job couldn't save all files within the allotted time.\n",

    "* Increased Metadata Overhead: Each Parquet file carries metadata. With numerous small files, managing this metadata can significantly impact performance.\n",

    "* Slower Filesystem Operations: Operations like listing or opening files may become slower with numerous small files, affecting performance of administrative tasks or data processing.\n",
    "* Suboptimal Data Processing: Some data processing frameworks may be less efficient when handling many small files, incurring overhead in file opening, network communication, and task scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to balance partitioning data for query performance while avoiding the drawbacks of too many small files. It's recommended to choose a partitioning strategy that aligns with your querying patterns and dataset scale, considering factors like storage costs, filesystem limitations, and processing efficiency."

    "**Well done!** In this lab, you implemented a simple data lake using Amazon S3, AWS Glue ETL, Glue Crawler, and Amazon Athena. You ingested raw data into an S3 bucket, which acted as the storage layer of the data lake. You then used AWS GLUE ETL to transform and prepare the data for analysis. After that, you used the Glue Crawler to catalog the data, and then used Athena to run SQL queries directly against the data lake without the need for complex data movement or transformation. This setup allows for easy and efficient querying of data stored in S3, enabling organizations to derive valuable insights from their data assets."
