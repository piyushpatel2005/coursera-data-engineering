# Week 2: Data Warehouse and Lakehouse

This week explains key architectural ideas about Warehouse and Lakehouses. The first lab covers Datalake using AWS Glue service with a practical lab. The second lab covers lakehouse architecture using Apache Iceberg with AWS Lake Formation.

To replicate the lab, you may have to create jupyter environment using Cloud 9. The scripts can be executed using `source scripts/setup_jupyter_env.sh`.
