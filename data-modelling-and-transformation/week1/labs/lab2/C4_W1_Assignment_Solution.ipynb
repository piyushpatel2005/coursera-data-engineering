    "Data modeling is one of the pillars of Data Engineering, it involves organizing bits of data into defined models with their respective data types and relationships between each other. Most of the work in data modeling involves using predefined techniques or patterns on a raw dataset based on the business's requirements. Data models like the **Star Schema** and **One Big Table (OBT)** have become popular for analytical workloads in recent years. In this lab, you will apply these models to the `classicmodels` dataset."
