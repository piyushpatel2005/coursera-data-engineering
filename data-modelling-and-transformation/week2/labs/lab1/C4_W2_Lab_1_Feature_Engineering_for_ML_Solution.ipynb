    "In this lab, you will implement a model to transform the data, creating a dataset ready for training a Machine Learning (ML) model. You will perform basic transformations useful for numerical and categorical variables, preparing the data to train a recommender system.

    "\n",
    "A **feature** is a numerical representation of a phenomenon. Choosing or creating the most appropriate features is a process called **Feature Engineering**. Feature Engineering is a crucial step in the data preparation process for machine learning and data analysis. It involves the creation, transformation, and selection of features (variables, attributes, or columns) from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. Effective feature engineering can significantly enhance the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Feature Engineering you will be working on this lab involves three steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data extraction**: Collecting data and then extracting the required dataset to train the ML model. This involves connecting to different data sources and handling large data volumes to search for the initial dataset.\n",
    "- **Feature creation**: This involves the creation of numerical features from the initial dataset. Some examples are:\n",
    "    - *Data labelling*: Designating labels to each record to later train a model to predict the label on new data.\n",
    "    - *Text embeddings*: Creating vector embeddings based on text, is done to create a representation of text data that an ML model can learn from. \n",
    "    - *Categorical data encoding*: Encoding categorical data to a numerical representation.\n",
    "- **Feature storage**: After the data is cleaned and transformed, the final dataset should be stored in a system that the ML team has access to, where they can explore the dataset and run the training for the ML model. Here you will split the final dataset into a training and testing dataset and store each in an S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will reexamine the assignment for Course 1 Week 4, in which you build a comprehensive pipeline to feed a Machine Learning model, specifically a content-based filtering recommender system based on the `classicmodels` database. Here you will be provided with the model and the scripts required to train it, but you will be modelling and implementing the required transformations to deliver the datasets for training and testing the ML model. In this lab, you will replicate steps of the pipeline using just this notebook, mainly for testing the logic of a machine learning pipeline in just one place."

    "Although the best practices to generate a train and test split of your dataset are out of the scope of this course, you will perform a basic splitting of the `model_df` dataframe. This is done with the help of the [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) library. `scikit-learn` is an open-source ML library which, among other features, allows you to transform and prepare your dataset for ML models. In particular, you will use the `train_test_split()` method. You will choose a test size of 20% of the rows from the original dataframe. The `random_state` parameter allows replicating the process, so avoid changing its value."

    "\n",
    "The objective of Feature Engineering for a numerical variable is to identify a more effective method of representing the variable within the model. \"Effective\" implies enhanced validity, stronger predictive power, and improved interpretability. For continuous numerical variables, you will usually perform a Standardization process. Sometimes for other numerical variables, depending on the context you can create ranges or bins. In this particular case you can see that for the user's age it will make more sense to create buckets with ranges of ages instead of scaling this variable, as this can help you to provide more accurate recommendations to the user depending on their age range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardization** refers to removing the mean of a numerical dataset and then scale it to unit variance. Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for ML models as they might not behave the best if the individual features do not look similar to standard normally distributed data. In `scikit-learn` the standardization process happens independently for each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the continuous numerical variables in each of the datasets:\n",
    "- The `users_df` only has one continuous numerical variable which corresponds to the `creditlimit` that each customer has.\n",
    "- The `items_df` has several continuous numerical variables: `quantityinstock`, `buyprice`, `msrp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of standardizing your data with `scikit-learn` can be divided into the following steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "Categorical variables denote groupings or classifications. Although they might be represented by numbers, these numbers symbolize categories instead of quantitative values. There are three categories of categorical variables: binary, nominal, and ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary categories: Represent yes/no, true/false or 1/0 outcomes such as if a person has a license or not or a coin flip result.\n",
    "- Nominal categories: Represent categories with no intrinsic order or ranking. Those categories are mutually exclusive and do not have a meaningful numerical relationship. Some examples could be the hair color of a group of people: black, brown, blonde, red, etc or here, the product categories and the user's locations.\n",
    "- Ordinal variables: Ordinal variables represent categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal or known. They indicate a relative position or order. An example could be the ratings of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For categorical data there are several types of transformations such as label encoding, one hot encoding, binary encoding, among others. For this dataset you are going to focus only on the One-hot Encoding transformations for the categorical features. One-hot encoding is a popular method for converting categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction. It creates a binary column for each category and returns a matrix where each column represents one possible category of the original data. Each original value is replaced with a binary vector indicating the presence of the value."

As done in previous transformations, the first step is to instantiate the object from the `OneHotEncoder` class. For that, you will also use the `handle_unknown=\"ignore\"` option; this option specifies how to handle an unknown category.

By using tools like `StandardScaler` from `scikit-learn`, you learned how to standardize numerical features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This transformation is crucial for many ML algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input data.\n",

This method allows ML algorithms, which typically require numerical input, to effectively utilize categorical data. One-hot encoding ensures that no ordinal relationship is implied among the categories, preserving the integrity of the categorical data.\n",
